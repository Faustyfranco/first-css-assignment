    <h1>This is Our About Page</h1>
    <p>Capacity Bay is an organization that offers IT courses. I am happy and priviledged to be among
    the students that are on free training. It was quite hard from the begining, but, I am happy for the
    improvement with the help of wonderful tutors in capacity Bay. The tutors in Capacity Bay ahve something
    in common which is, respectful, patient and humility which has been helpful to especially newbies
    to catch up with the training. Capacity Bay tutors are actually well trained and that is
    commendable and appreciated. I am grateful to Capacity Bay for this great opportunity.
    Thank you all.
